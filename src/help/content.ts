      "Select POWERGRID LAB in the top bar or enter #POWERGRID in the address bar. The exact hash opens the lab directly; refresh keeps it open and browser Back/Forward follows route changes.",

      "Read the calculated three-phase line current and resistive loss at both transmission voltages. Save stores this lab experiment separately in this browser; JSON and CSV exports contain the displayed inputs and calculated readings.",
      "In Radial feeder, edit source line-to-line voltage and each consumer group's active/reactive load and minimum voltage. Read solved bus voltages, branch currents, sending/receiving P and Q, and voltage constraints.",
      "Edit branch resistance, reactance and thermal limit. Turn off In service to open a feeder; downstream consumer groups are reported as unserved. Set a comparison reference before editing to compare served voltage, real losses and unserved demand.",
      "Save the radial scenario locally or export its actual solved values as JSON or CSV. The saved radial scenario uses a separate browser key from the step-up experiment and the active customer project.",
      "The model assumes balanced three-phase operation, constant transmitted power and power factor, equal resistance per phase, and ideal transformer voltage changes. It does not solve distribution losses, receiving-end voltage, transformer efficiency or a network load flow.",
      "The radial model uses one fixed-voltage source, balanced constant-P/Q consumer loads and per-phase series impedance. It reports convergence and disconnected islands; shunt capacitance, transformer taps, generator limits, meshed flow, protection and dynamics are outside this model.",
